├── routes
├── views

- **Models**: Database schemas (Users, Products)
- **Controllers**: Business logic and request handling
- **Routes**: API endpoints and route mapping
- **Views**: EJS templates for UI
- **Middleware**: Authentication and role Authorization

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- Sessions are used to manage logged-in users
- Middleware ensures:
  - Only authenticated users can access protected routes
  - Only admins can perform update and delete operations
- Role checks are enforced both at route and UI level

---

## 📦 CRUD Operations

| Operation | Role Allowed |
|---------|--------------|
| View Products | User, Staff, Admin |
| Add Product | Staff, Admin |
| Update Product | Admin |
| Delete Product | Admin |

All operations follow RESTful conventions using proper HTTP methods.
